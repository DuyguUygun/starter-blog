I am a philosopher interested in the epistemology of science. I currently work on the project "Extended Scientific Virtue" funded by Turkish Scientific and Technological Research Council (TUBITAK) and the European Commission under Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Cofund program “Co-Funded Brain Circulation2 Scheme” 

I finished my PhD at Heidelberg University and the University of Helsinki in October 2020. My dissertation "Communication and the Origins of Personhood" is accesible [here](https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/320157).
